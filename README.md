This is just the Readme for the game, the dippid sender is more or less self-explanatory.

# 👾 Face Invaders

Welcome to **Face Invaders**

If you think the game isn’t pretty…
**maybe take a look in the mirror first.** 😉

---

## 🎮 About the Game

Face Invaders is a chaotic, arcade-style shooter inspired by classic space invader games — but with a twist:

* Enemies? Faces.
* Player? Also a face.
* Bullets? Questionable characters.
* Dignity? Optional.

You control your character by tilting your phone and firing with the button input (via the DIPPI app). Survive waves of increasingly aggressive enemies while protecting yourself with bunkers.

## 📱 IMPORTANT: How to Play

🚨 **You MUST hold your phone horizontally (landscape mode)** 🚨
If you don’t… well… things will go very wrong very quickly.

## 🕹 Controls

* **Tilt phone while holding horizontally (left/right)** → Move player
* **Button press** → Shoot
* **Mouse click (on death screen)** → Respawn or Quit
